During this challenge, I made use of all the available student support services including office hours facilitated by TA, tutor sessions, ask the class slack channel and AskBCS learning assistant.
In addition to the above-mentioned resources, I also made use of google search and other websites.
I modified some codes that I browsed from google website.
The first part of this challenge is analysis of financial data from a company to determine.
	Total number of months included in the data set.
	Net total amount of profit/losses over entire period
	Changes in profit and loss over entire period and the average of this changes
	The greatest increase in profit (date and time) over the entire period.
	The greatest decrease in profit (date and time) over the entire period.

I used pandas to import my data into visual studio code. Jupyter notebook is the virtual environment used for the data analysis.
I began my analysis by creating a list for the profit, monthly_changes, and date variables, the variables were then initialized as required.
For loop was used to loop through row of the data set. Appropriate coding was done to arrive at the desired results.

The second part of this challenge was about an analysis of votes secured by three candidates in a county election to determine,
	The total number of votes cast
	A complete list of candidates who received votes.
	The percentage of votes each candidate won.
	The total number of votes each candidate won.
	The winner of the election

Charles Casper Stockham, Raymond Anthony Doane and Diana DeGette are the three candidates that stood for the election in the 3 counties.
A similar approach mentioned above was applied to this data set to resolve the issue at hand.
In the end Diana DeGette emerged as the winner. Results and analysis have been pushed to git hub repository.
